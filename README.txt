READ EVERYTHING BEFORE USE.

To start the program, run the app.exe file

A screen should pop up. Enter the number of players that are playing by clicking on the
arrow buttons or by using the up and down arrow keys on your keyboard. There is a maximum
of 30 and minimum of 1 player(s) that can play.

Click the Enter button or the enter button on your keyboard.

The main window should load up now. Wait for the player names to be visible. This means
that the program is fully loaded and ready for use. At any point while this window is
visible, the player names can be editted. To edit the player name, click on the player
number that you want to be and replace the default "Player X" with your name.

The current player's turn is indicated by a blue highlight on their name. To input a
score, simply press the radio button that represents the score or use the keyboard
controls listed below. Then press the Enter score button or the enter key on the keyboard.

Miss:	0 or -
One:	1
Two:	2

Four:	4
Five:	5
Six:	6
Seven:	7
Eight:	8
Nine:	9

  Note: numpad keys may or may not work due to limitations in the keyboard checking method.

When it is the next player's turn, the previous player's name will be un-highlighted and the
next player's name will be highlighted. Once each player has made at least one bowl, a set
of rankings can be generated by clicking File -> Generate Rankings or Alt then F then G or
with Ctrl+G. These will generate rankings based on the current total scores. This list of
rankings can be generated as many times as needed and updates each time with the current
scores and player names.

When the game has finished, a list of rankings will be generated automatically and all input
buttons will be disabled, however the player names can still be editted and the rankings
re-generated to reflect these changes.

Inside of the rankings screen, there is a save button which allows for the current game to
be saved to a file on disk. This file is saved as a .csv file with the name and location set
by the user. This file can be opened with a spreadsheet program to view the individual bowls
of each player throughout the entire game.
